    <h1>Why adopt ginger?</h1>
    <p>
      Ginger is an amazing dog. She is so good with people, but sadly she's not
      good with other female dogs. For some reason two Female dogs don't get
      along well because of dominant issue. Other than that she is sweet, she
      loves to play and shes such a goofball. Anyone would be so lucky to have
      her as part of a family member. <span class="orange-text"></span>
